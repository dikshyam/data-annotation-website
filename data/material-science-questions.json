            "text": "Crystal structure directly influences mechanical properties through atomic packing and slip systems. FCC metals (like aluminum) have high ductility due to numerous slip systems, while HCP metals (like titanium) are stronger but less ductile with fewer slip systems. BCC metals (like iron) offer a balance. Grain size also mattersâ€”smaller grains increase strength through the Hall-Petch relationship. Dislocations, point defects, and grain boundaries all contribute to determining a metal's strength, hardness, and ductility."

            "text": "The mechanical properties of metals are fundamentally determined by their crystal structure. Different arrangements (BCC, FCC, HCP) create varying degrees of atomic packing and available slip planes, which dictate how easily dislocations move when stress is applied. These factors determine whether a metal will be brittle or ductile, and how much force it can withstand before deforming or fracturing."

            "text": "Crystal structures in metals establish how atoms are arranged and bonded, directly affecting mechanical behavior. The number and orientation of slip systems, which are determined by crystal structure, control deformation mechanisms. Additionally, grain boundaries serve as obstacles to dislocation movement, increasing strength but potentially reducing ductility. These structural features explain why some metals can be easily shaped while others resist deformation."
