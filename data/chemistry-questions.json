This is a physical change and not chemically altering the polymer. It should still retain its chemical properties as before. However, other properties have changed. It is now a poorer insulator since the air pockets have been removed. It will also be more rigid for similar reasons. The acetone ought to be able to be driven off by heating it in a ventilated space as acetone is quite volatile."

                    "text": "Polylactic acid polymers are creating a lot of interest these days because they're biodegradable. On the downside, corn starch is often one of the starting materials...and corn is also used as a food source, so there's some controversy [https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/corn-plastic-to-the-rescue-126404720/?c=y&page=2] over the wisdom of this approach. I think I've found a site that takes the approach you're basing your question on...but there are a couple of issues with the equation you've written. So, I'll answer this question in two parts. Plastic from starch is what you saw in the video; PLA from starch is what you asked about. Plastic from starch. The recipe [https://web.archive.org/web/20130918052759/http://green-plastics.net/discussion/54-student/131-qaa-help-with-cornstarch-pla-plastic-project] for the plastics-from-starch uses starch, glycerol, acetic acid (the $\\ce{C2H4O2}$ in your equation) and water as a solvent. (They do not add lactic acid, the $\\ce{C3H8O3}$ in your equation, but lactic acid can be produced by hydrolysis of the starch.) With the starch-acetic acid-glycerol recipe, you do not actually make a PLA polymer, but a starch polymer that is somewhat like it instead. (Ref [https://web.archive.org/web/20130918070752/http://green-plastics.net/discussion/54-student/132-qaa-i-want-to-make-corn-plastic-utensils]) So, starch is a polymer that looks like this [https://web.archive.org/web/20120514074457/http://djbreile.webs.com:80/reactionmechanism.htm]: In water, it tends to ball up into globular clusters due to hydrogen bonding. By adding acetic acid and heating the starch in water, you \"denature\" the starch and turn it into \"disordered chains\" that stretch out. When you let these disordered chains dry, they become entangled and form a flexible film, the plastic. In this recipe, the glycerol is included as a plasticizer [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasticizer], so it is unchanged chemically in the reaction. The glycerol also helps to keep the starch stretched out by stabilizing it with hydrogen bonding. Plasticizers (as the name would indicate) are additives that increase the plasticity of a plastic and make it more durable or flexible. Changing the amount of glycerol in the recipe can have a big effect on the strength of the plastic film you make. This is the process you're seeing in the videos, I think. Making PLA from starch. This is going to be a bit of a challenge to explain depending on your understanding of organic chemistry, but hopefully the pictures will help. When you make PLA commercially, you digest starch, usually with a bacteria [http://www.springerlink.com/content/v14uxt2r823glaex/], to turn it into lactic acid (see picture below for the structure of lactic acid). This lactic acid must be purified to make a high quality product. If you just combine a bunch of lactic acid molecules to make PLA, one water molecule would be lost each time they combine...sort of like this [https://www.materialsworldmodules.org/tai-nguyen/condensation-polymerization/]. (This is an acid and alcohol combining, not two acids, but the idea is the same.) The water in the polymerization reaction leads to a poor quality plastic. So, in commercial synthetic schemes, two purified lactic acid molecules are reacted to form lactide...they come together in a controlled condensation reaction, with the loss of water. (Ref for picture [https://web.archive.org/web/20130621172141/http://wiki.chemprime.chemeddl.org:80/index.php/BIODEGRADABLE_PLASTICS].) Now you can use the lactide, i.e. \"lactic acids with the water removed\", to do the polymerization to PLA. You add an initiator to open the lactic acid by breaking the bond between the $\\ce{O-C}$ in $\\ce{O-C=O}$ and this gives you 2 lactic acid molecules hooked together...which react with another lactide molecule to add two more lactic acid molecules to the growing chain, and so on. And that's how the PLA forms. So the reaction sequence is strach-> lactic acid-> lactide + $\\ce{H2O}$ -> PLA Probably more than you wanted to know!"

The number of monomers in a chain is called the degree of polymerization. $\\overline {M_w}$ is the weight average molecular weight. It is a way of determining the molecular mass of a polymer. As polymer molecules have different chain lengths, the average molecular mass will depend on the method of averaging. For example, we can use the number average molecular weight which is based on different type of averaging. As for the unit, it's as you mentioned: g/mol. In biochemistry, they use the dalton (Da) as a mass unit for biopolymers (1 $N_a.$Da= g/mol, where $N_a.$ is the Avogadro number). So, when we say a protein has a molecular weight of 64000 g\u00b7mol$^{\u22121}$, it has also a mass of 64 kDa. P.S. To be rigorous, we have to say ** molecular mass** instead of ** molecular weight**. But this was an old way of naming things."

Polymer slurry [http://www.ashland.com/products/sc-50-fluidized-polymer-slurry] seems to be made of one or more hydrophilic superabsorbent [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superabsorbent_polymer] polymers, such as polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, or carboxymethylcellulose that produce a thick viscous slurry when mixed with water. It does not repel water so much as the opposite. It is so hydrophilic that it absorbs water before the water can reach the concrete or the steel. Then this slurry becomes thicker the more water it absorbs so that the rate of diffusion of water through the slurry decreases. Ultimately, this action creates a hydrogel [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogel#Hydrogels], which may be quite strong, despite being mostly water, due to extensive hydrogen bond crosslinks. Other applications of polymer slurry seem to be in the drilling industry to modulate the viscosity of drilling fluids."

But in the monomers at the very ends of a polymer chain, there is an unfilled bond, a carbon atom with only three bonds filled.

There are a number of ways which an additional atom amy bond with the carbon radical in a process called termination [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_polymerization#Termination]. Typically this is done by combination or inhibition. Combination is the process where two radicals come together to form a bond leaving no free radicals to continue the reaction. This may occur when two radical chains combine or when a selected radical is added to cease the reaction. This radical could be the other half of the initiator which began the radical polymerization.

                    "text": "The scientist who coined the term polymer, J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius, used the word to refer to different substances which had the same empirical formula [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6ns_Jacob_Berzelius#New_chemical_terms]. In this sense, benzene is a polymer of ethyne (acetylene), because benzene $\\ce{C6H6}$ and ethyne $\\ce{C2H2}$ have the same empirical formula, namely $\\ce{CH}$. In other words, all substances with molecular formula $\\ce{(CH)_x}$ were polymers of the smallest unit in the family (in this case, $\\ce{C2H2}$, because $\\ce{CH}$ molecules are only known as extremely fleeting species on Earth, though they are abundant in space). However, that was back in the 1830s, when we had no clue about atomic and molecular structure (in 1808, one of the eminent chemists of the time, John Dalton, defended $\\ce{HO}$ as the formula for water). The meaning of the term has evolved over time to accommodate our increase in knowledge. The most current IUPAC recommendations on polymer nomenclature (Compendium of Polymer Terminology and Nomenclature - IUPAC Recommendations 2008 [https://iupac.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Compendium-of-Polymer-Terminology-and-Nomenclature-IUPAC-Recommendations-2008.pdf]) states the definition of polymer as: A polymer is a substance composed of macromolecules. And, fortunately, they also define a macromolecule as: Molecule of high relative molecular mass, the structure of which essentially comprises the multiple repetition of units derived, actually or conceptually, from molecules of low relative molecular mass. Note 1: In many cases, especially for synthetic polymers, a molecule can be regarded as having a high relative molecular mass if the addition or removal of one or a few of the units has a negligible effect on the molecular properties. This statement fails in the case of certain properties of macromolecules which may be critically dependent on fine details of the molecular structure, e.g., the enzymatic properties of polypeptides. Note 2: If a part or the whole of the molecule has a high relative molecular mass and essentially comprises the multiple repetition of units derived, actually or conceptually, from molecules of low relative molecular mass, it may be described as either macromolecular or polymeric, or by polymer used adjectivally. Note 3: In most cases, the polymer can actually be made by direct polymerization of its parent monomer but in other cases, e.g., poly(vinyl alcohol), the description \u2018conceptual\u2019 denotes that an indirect route is used because the nominal monomer does not exist. As you can see, there is quite a bit of detailing to try to keep things consistent. Observe that the definition speaks of high relative molecular mass, and this point is expanded upon in Note 1. With these considerations, benzene is not a polymer - it is certainly a very small molecule, and adding or removing a portion of it (presumably cyclooctatetraene [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooctatetraene] $\\ce{C8H8}$ and cyclobutadiene [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclobutadiene] $\\ce{C4H4}$, respectively) would result in a substance with drastically different properties. In some sense, Berzelius wasn't really wrong to call benzene a polymer, because for all he knew back then, benzene could well have the formula $\\ce{C20000H20000}$ (actually, it was not widely believed that \"large\" molecules could exist at all, with some resistance to the idea existing as late as the 1920s-1930s). He did the best with what knowledge was available to him. But now we can do better, and it just is more convenient and self-consistent to not label benzene as a polymer. This isn't to say that, however, that benzene and ethyne are completely chemically unrelated. There is in fact a close relationship, in that ethyne can efficiently undergo a [2+2+2] cycloaddition reaction to form benzene. This is not exploited industrially, however, as there are much cheaper (and safer) ways of making it."

There are two ways of decreasing the amount of water stored without using heat. The first one is to increase the salt load of additional water and place the hydrogel within this salted water. The salt in the water will decrease the total water absorbed by the hydrogel and the hydrogel will shrink, giving up some of its water. A more complete and full way to make the hydrogel to give up its water is the addition of an acid. Lowering the pH of the hydrogel to below 3.5 will convert all the sodium carboxylates to the free acid form which does not absorb water. These hydrogels are pH-sensitive, and if you plot pH vs absorbed fluid, you would find a bell curve that starts around 4.5 or 5.0, tops out around 7.5 and decreases as you increase the pH until around 10.5 to 11.0."

Mild pH Adjustment (Acidic Washing) Mechanism: Lowering the pH with a mild acid (such as dilute HCl or acetic acid) protonates the carboxylate groups. When protonated, these groups lose their negative charge, diminishing their affinity for the cationic dye and promoting desorption. Advantages and Caveats: While this method is effective in breaking the electrostatic interaction, the acid strength and exposure time must be carefully controlled to avoid hydrolysis of cellulose or loss of functional groups. Typically, a very dilute acid is recommended, followed by thorough rinsing until neutral pH is restored"
