The carboxylate oxygens from suberate ligands will occupy some coordination sites.\\n\\n4) **Architectural influence on coordination chemistry**:\\n   - The linear dicarboxylate creates 1D chain or 2D/3D network structures\\n   - Mn(II) centers are bridged by suberate ligands\\n   - Remaining coordination sites on Mn(II) can accommodate additional ligands (water, other donors)\\n   - The flexible -(CH2)6- chain allows conformational flexibility\\n   - This creates potential for guest molecule inclusion or solvent coordination\\n\\nThe linear dicarboxylate architecture creates a coordination polymer where Mn(II) centers are connected through suberate bridges, with the flexible alkyl chain allowing structural adaptability and the remaining coordination sites on Mn(II) available for additional ligand binding, making it potentially useful for applications like gas storage, separation, or catalysis.']"

The anhydride rings provide the primary contribution to the high Tg through backbone rigidity, while the methoxy groups enhance intermolecular interactions.\\n\\nThe methoxy side groups contribute moderate intermolecular forces through dipole interactions, while the cyclic anhydride rings provide the dominant contribution through backbone rigidity and strong intermolecular forces, together resulting in the exceptionally high glass transition temperature of 260°C.\"]"

While hydrogen bonding increases intermolecular attractions, the fundamental weakness of heteroatom-containing bonds and their susceptibility to oxidation generally results in lower thermal stability.\\n\\n**Most Influential Structural Features:**\\n1. Bond dissociation energies of heteroatom-containing bonds\\n2. Susceptibility to oxidative degradation at heteroatom sites\\n3.

While the extensive hydrogen bonding network (3 donors, 11 acceptors) increases intermolecular attractions, the 17 heteroatoms introduce weaker covalent bonds and oxidation-susceptible sites that dominate the thermal behavior.
