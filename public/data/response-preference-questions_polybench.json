First, let's examine the target polymer structure: - Contains repeating units with ether linkages (-O-) - Has thioether groups (-S-CH2-CH2-) - Contains ester linkages (-COO-) - Has para-substituted phenyl rings  2. Looking at the proposed monomers: - Both monomers are identical - Each contains:   * A chloroformate group (-COCl)   * An ethylene spacer (-CH2CH2-)   * A thioether linkage (-S-CH2-CH2-)   * A para-hydroxyphenyl group  3. Condensation reaction mechanism: - The chloroformate groups (-COCl) react with hydroxyl groups (-OH) - This forms ester linkages (-COO-) with elimination of HCl - The reaction occurs between the terminal\"]"
