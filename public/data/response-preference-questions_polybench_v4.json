The rotatable bonds at imide linkages and aromatic junctions allow the polymer chains to adopt different conformations during heating/solvent processing without disrupting the overall electronic conjugation. This creates a high-performance material that maintains excellent mechanical properties and thermal stability while remaining processable through controlled flexibility points in the backbone structure.']"
